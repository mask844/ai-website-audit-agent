🚀 AI-Driven Website Audit & Lead Magnet Agent
Overview
This project demonstrates a high-conversion AI Lead Magnet designed to bridge the gap between digital operations and business automation. Built as a professional showcase for Gianluigi Mautone's portfolio , it utilizes a multi-agent architecture to analyze website performance and generate immediate, actionable value for users.




🧠 How It Works
Lead Capture: A modern, minimalist frontend collects the user's URL and Email.


Autonomous Analysis: An n8n workflow  triggers a series of operations:

Data Scraping: Extracts raw text and structure from the target website.


AI Processing: An LLM (GPT-4o) performs a UX/Automation audit based on Digital Operations best practices.



Value Delivery: The system generates a professional report and sends it via Gmail API, simulating a human consultant's touch.

🛠 Tech Stack
Workflow Automation: n8n (Self-hosted on Docker via DuckDNS).

AI Engine: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini (Prompt Engineering).

Frontend: HTML5, Tailwind CSS (Mobile-responsive).

Operations: Google Cloud Console (OAuth 2.0), Gmail API.

💼 Professional Context
This solution is an evolution of my experience in:


E-Commerce Operations: Managing complex data (thousands of SKUs) and identifying revenue-growth trends.


Digital Real Estate: Enhancing corporate web presence and optimizing lead retention through active listening and needs analysis.



Education: Specialized training in AI & Business Automation at Academy Rapido (2025).
